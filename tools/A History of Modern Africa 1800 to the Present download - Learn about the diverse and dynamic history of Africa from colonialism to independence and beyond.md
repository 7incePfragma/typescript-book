One of the strengths of the book is that it places emphasis on African agency, particularly during the colonial period, and shows how Africans were not passive victims of external forces, but active agents of their own history. The book also highlights the importance of the long-term militarization of African political culture, and how violence and warfare have shaped the continent's history and society. The book does not shy away from addressing the complex and controversial issues that have marked Africa's modern history, such as ethnicity, gender, religion, class, and identity.
 
One of the challenges of the book is that it tries to cover a vast and diverse continent in a single volume, and inevitably has to leave out some details and nuances. The book also focuses more on the political and economic aspects of Africa's modern history, and less on the cultural and social aspects. The book could have benefited from more attention to the role of art, literature, music, and popular culture in Africa's modern history. The book also could have included more voices and perspectives from African sources, such as oral histories, memoirs, novels, and films.
 
Overall, A History of Modern Africa: 1800 to the Present by Richard J. Reid is a valuable and informative resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the modern history of Africa. The book provides a clear and concise overview of the main events and themes that have shaped the continent's history and society. The book also offers insights and analysis that help readers to understand the current issues and challenges facing Africa in the twenty-first century.

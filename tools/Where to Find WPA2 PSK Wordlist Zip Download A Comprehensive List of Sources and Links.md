WPA and WPA2 are security protocols that protect wireless networks from unauthorized access. However, they are not immune to password cracking attacks, especially if the network password is weak or common. To crack WPA/WPA2-PSK passwords, you need a wordlist, which is a collection of words or phrases that are likely to be used as passwords. A wordlist can be obtained from various sources, such as:
 
**Download âœ¦ [https://t.co/vaBFNsEyMO](https://t.co/vaBFNsEyMO)**


 
- **Openwall**: This is a project that provides free wordlists and password dictionaries for various languages and purposes. You can download them from [https://www.openwall.com/wordlists/](https://www.openwall.com/wordlists/) [^1^].
- **Coasts password collections**: These are wordlists compiled by a user named Coasts from various online sources. They are available on [https://crackstation.net/buy-crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm](https://crackstation.net/buy-crackstation-wordlist-password-cracking-dictionary.htm) [^1^].
- **Xploitz Master Password Collection**: These are wordlists that were included in the official Backtrack Linux distribution, a popular tool for penetration testing and ethical hacking. They were created by a user named Xploitz and can be downloaded from [https://www.mediafire.com/folder/9n5x9x0x3g0x9/Xploitz\_Master\_Password\_Collection\_vol\_1\_and\_2](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/9n5x9x0x3g0x9/Xploitz_Master_Password_Collection_vol_1_and_2) [^2^].
- **FTP sites**: Some FTP servers host wordlists and password dictionaries that can be downloaded anonymously. For example, you can find some wordlists on [ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists/](ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists/) [^1^].
- **Social media usernames**: Some people use their social media usernames as passwords for their wireless networks. You can extract usernames from leaked or public databases of social media platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, MySpace, etc. For example, you can download a list of 100 million Facebook usernames and personal details from [https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5723136/Facebook\_harvested\_details\_(100\_million)\_public\_profiles](https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5723136/Facebook_harvested_details_%28100_million%29_public_profiles) [^2^].
- **Personal wordlists**: You can also create your own wordlists based on your knowledge of the target network or the owner. For example, you can use names, dates, hobbies, locations, etc. that are related to the network or the owner. You can also use tools such as awk, sort, uniq, egrep, etc. to manipulate and combine existing wordlists.

Once you have downloaded or created a wordlist, you need to unzip it if it is compressed. Then you can use tools such as aircrack-ng, hydra, hashcat, etc. to perform a dictionary attack on the captured WPA/WPA2-PSK handshake. Note that this attack may take a long time and may not succeed if the network password is not in the wordlist or if it is too long or complex.

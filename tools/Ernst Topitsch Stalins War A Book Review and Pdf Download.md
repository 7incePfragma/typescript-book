Ernst Topitsch was a German philosopher and historian who wrote a controversial book titled *Stalin's War: A Radical New Theory of the Origins of the Second World War*. In this book, he argued that Stalin was the main instigator of the war and that he planned to use it as a means to spread communism across Europe and beyond.

Topitsch based his theory on various sources, such as Soviet archives, German military records, and eyewitness accounts. He claimed that Stalin had prepared for a war of aggression against Germany and its allies since the early 1930s, and that he intended to launch a preemptive strike in July 1941. However, Hitler's Operation Barbarossa foiled his plans and forced him to fight a defensive war.
 
Topitsch's book was first published in German in 1985 and translated into English in 1987. It received mixed reviews from critics and scholars, some of whom praised it for its originality and courage, while others dismissed it as revisionist and biased. The book has been compared and contrasted with other works that challenge the conventional view of World War II, such as Viktor Suvorov's *The Chief Culprit* and Joachim Hoffmann's *Stalin's War of Extermination*.

One of the main sources that Topitsch used to support his theory was the so-called Mekhlis Report, a document that allegedly contained Stalin's orders for a massive offensive against Germany in July 1941. The report was named after Lev Mekhlis, the head of the Soviet political commissars, who supposedly delivered it to Stalin on June 22, 1941, the same day that Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Topitsch claimed that he obtained a copy of the report from a former Soviet officer who defected to the West.
 
However, the authenticity and validity of the Mekhlis Report have been disputed by many historians and experts. Some have argued that the report was a forgery or a fabrication, while others have pointed out that it contained factual errors and inconsistencies. For example, the report mentioned that the Soviet Union had 20,000 tanks and 28,000 planes ready for the offensive, which were far more than the actual numbers. The report also contradicted other evidence that showed that the Soviet forces were unprepared and surprised by the German attack.
 
Another source that Topitsch used to support his theory was Ernst Topitsch himself. He claimed that he had personal experience and knowledge of Stalin's war plans, as he had served as a German soldier and intelligence officer during World War II. He said that he had witnessed and participated in several battles and operations against the Soviet army, and that he had access to classified information and documents. He also said that he had interviewed and interrogated many Soviet prisoners of war and defectors, who confirmed his suspicions about Stalin's intentions.
 
However, Topitsch's credibility and objectivity as a source have also been questioned by many critics and scholars. Some have accused him of being biased and prejudiced against the Soviet Union and communism, as he had been a member of the Nazi party and a supporter of Hitler. Some have also suggested that he had ulterior motives and agendas for writing his book, such as seeking fame or revenge. Some have even doubted his honesty and integrity, as he had admitted to falsifying some of his academic credentials and publications.

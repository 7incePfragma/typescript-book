Dynamic disks are a type of disk storage that can offer more flexibility and performance than basic disks. They allow you to create volumes that span multiple disks, mirror data for redundancy, or stripe data for speed. However, managing dynamic disks can be tricky, especially if you are not familiar with the Windows Disk Management tool.
 
That's why you need a reliable and easy-to-use software like AOMEI Dynamic Disk Manager Home Edition (DDMHE). DDMHE is a free tool that helps you manage dynamic volumes such as simple volumes, spanned volumes, striped volumes, mirrored volumes, and RAID-5 volumes in a graphic and intuitive user-interface[^3^]. You can resize, move, extend, shrink, delete, create, format, and convert dynamic volumes without losing data or rebooting your computer.

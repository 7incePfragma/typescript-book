# Riot Points Code Generator â How to Get Free RP for Android Games
 
If you are a fan of Android games like League of Legends: Wild Rift, Teamfight Tactics, or Legends of Runeterra, you might be interested in getting some free Riot Points (RP) to unlock premium content and features. RP is the in-game currency used by Riot Games, the developer of these popular titles. However, buying RP with real money can be expensive and not everyone can afford it. That's why some people look for alternative ways to get RP, such as using a Riot Points Code Generator.
 
A Riot Points Code Generator is a tool that claims to generate free RP codes that you can redeem in your Riot Games account. These codes are supposed to give you a certain amount of RP, depending on the generator. Some generators claim to offer up to 10,000 RP per code, while others promise a more modest amount. However, the question is: do these generators really work? And are they safe to use?

## Do Riot Points Code Generators Work?
 
The short answer is: no, they don't. Riot Points Code Generators are scams that try to trick you into giving them your personal information, downloading malware, or completing surveys. They do not generate any valid RP codes and they cannot access the Riot Games servers. They are simply designed to lure you in with false promises and make money off you.
 
How do we know this? Because Riot Games has stated multiple times that there is no such thing as a free RP code generator and that they do not endorse or support any third-party websites or apps that claim to offer free RP. In fact, using these generators can get you banned from Riot Games services, as they violate the Terms of Service and the User Agreement. Here are some official statements from Riot Games on this matter:
 
- "There is no such thing as a Riot Points generator. If you see a website or video claiming otherwise, it's a scam." ([Source](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751894-Content-Refund-FAQ))
- "We will never ask for your account information in order to provide you with free Riot Points." ([Source](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751784-Scam-Websites-and-Free-RP))
- "Using third-party software or websites to gain an unfair advantage or access unauthorized content is strictly prohibited and can result in permanent bans." ([Source](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001259787-Riot-Games-Terms-of-Service))

Therefore, we strongly advise you to avoid using any Riot Points Code Generators and to report any suspicious websites or apps that claim to offer free RP. They are not worth your time and they can put your account and your device at risk.

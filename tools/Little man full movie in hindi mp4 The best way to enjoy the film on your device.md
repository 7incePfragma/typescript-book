The film was released on July 14, 2006 and received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the crude humor, the plot holes, and the use of computer-generated imagery to make Marlon Wayans look like a baby. However, some viewers found the film funny and entertaining, and it was a moderate box office success, grossing $101 million worldwide against a budget of $64 million.

Little Man is also available in Hindi dubbed version as Littleman 2006 1080p HD on Bilibili[^3^], a Chinese video-sharing website. However, the quality and legality of this version are questionable, and we do not recommend watching it unless you have no other options.
 
Little Man is a film that might appeal to fans of the Wayans brothers' style of comedy, which involves slapstick, physical gags, and raunchy jokes. The film also features some cameo appearances by celebrities such as Molly Shannon, Rob Schneider, David Alan Grier, and John Witherspoon. If you are looking for a light-hearted and silly comedy to watch with your friends or family, you might enjoy Little Man.

Little Man is also notable for its use of special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a baby. The scenes with Calvin were filmed twice: once with dwarf actors Linden Porco and Gabriel Pimentel together with the other actors, and once with Marlon Wayans alone wearing a green bodysuit against a green screen. In post-production, Porco's and Pimental's heads were replaced with Marlon's. Their bodies were also painted brown in order to match Marlon's face[^1^].
 
The film also features some references and homages to other movies and cartoons. For example, the basic plot of Little Man is taken directly from the Bugs Bunny short "Baby Buggy Bunny", where a bank robber named Baby Face Finster masquerades as an orphan baby to recover his loot from Bugs after it falls down his rabbit hole[^1^]. Another example is the fight between Calvin and D-Rex, which plays out almost like Mini-Me vs. Austin Powers in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, but in a different order[^1^].
 
Little Man also has some connections to other works by the Wayans brothers and their collaborators. For instance, Kelly Coffield, Lochlyn Munro, and David Alan Grier have all worked with Shawn and Marlon Wayans in previous projects such as Scary Movie, White Chicks, In Living Color, and The Wayans Bros TV show[^1^]. Moreover, Rob Schneider makes a cameo appearance as a dinosaur in Little Man, which is a reference to his role as a caveman in The Animal, another comedy film produced by the Wayans brothers.

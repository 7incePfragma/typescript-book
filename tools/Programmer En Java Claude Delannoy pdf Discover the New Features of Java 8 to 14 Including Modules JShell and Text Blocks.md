*Programmer en Java* is divided into four parts: the first part introduces the fundamentals of Java, such as data types, operators, control structures, arrays, strings, and classes. The second part explores the object-oriented features of Java, such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes, and inner classes. The third part covers the essential libraries of Java, such as collections, input/output, exceptions, threads, graphics, and networking. The fourth part presents some advanced topics of Java, such as generics, annotations, reflection, lambda expressions, and concurrency.
 
The book is designed for students in computer science, but it can also be used by anyone who wants to learn Java or improve their skills. The book contains many examples and exercises that illustrate the concepts and help the reader practice their coding. The book also comes with a CD-ROM that contains Eclipse Galileo for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, JDK 6 for Windows and Linux, and the source code of the examples from the book.
 
If you are interested in reading *Programmer en Java*, you can find a free PDF version of it on the Internet Archive[^1^]. You can also find a PDF version of another book by Claude Delannoy called *Java: 175 exercices corrigÃ©s pour maÃ®triser Java*, which contains 175 solved exercises for mastering Java[^3^]. These books are great resources for anyone who wants to learn Java or refresh their knowledge.
  
But why should you learn Java in the first place? What are the benefits of Java over other programming languages? Here are some of the reasons why Java is a great choice for anyone who wants to develop software applications:
 
- Java offers higher cross-functionality and portability as programs written in one platform can run across desktops, mobiles, embedded systems[^1^].
- Java is free, simple, object-oriented, distributed, supports multithreading, and offers multimedia and network support[^1^].
- Java is a mature language, therefore more stable and predictable. The Java Class Library enables cross-platform development[^2^].
- Java is easy to learn and has a clear and concise syntax. It also has a large and active community of developers who can help you with any questions or problems[^3^].
- Java is an object-oriented programming language that helps you improve the reusability and flexibility of code. It includes OOPs aspects like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation that allow you to reuse Java codes in other programming languages[^4^].

As you can see, Java has many advantages that make it a powerful and versatile programming language. If you want to learn more about Java and how to use it effectively, you should definitely read *Programmer en Java* by Claude Delannoy. This book will teach you everything you need to know about Java, from the basics to the advanced topics, with plenty of examples and exercises to help you practice your skills.

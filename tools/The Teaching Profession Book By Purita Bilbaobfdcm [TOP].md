One of the main features of The Teaching Profession is that it is based on the outcomes-based education (OBE) and the Philippine Professional Standards for Teachers (PPST). OBE is a learner-centered approach that focuses on the desired results of education rather than the inputs or processes. PPST is a set of indicators that define and measure teacher quality in relation to learner outcomes. The book helps teachers understand and apply these frameworks in their teaching practice.
 
Another feature of The Teaching Profession is that it is updated and relevant to the current context of education in the Philippines and the world. It incorporates the latest policies, laws, and reforms that affect the education system, such as the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, the Data Privacy Act of 2012, the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, and the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers. It also discusses the global trends and issues that influence education, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the ASEAN Integration, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
A third feature of The Teaching Profession is that it is practical and applicable to the real-world situations of teaching. It provides tips, strategies, and best practices that teachers can use in their daily work. It also offers case studies, scenarios, and simulations that challenge teachers to apply their learning in various contexts and settings. It also encourages teachers to reflect on their own experiences and beliefs and to share their insights and feedback with others.
